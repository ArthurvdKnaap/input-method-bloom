# Bloom input method
Keyboards where developped to move the hammers of a typewriter to the paper using physical buttons.
The physical buttons have gone; we are now staring at the screen to find these small buttons that
are ordered so that the hammers of the typewriter do not cling together.

Bloom is designed fom scratch to function optimally on touch screens. It allows the user to focus
on the written text, not on the writing itself. To get started Bloom does not require leaning
anything by heart.

# How does Bloom work
Bloom defines a very simple language consisting of only 3 different pen strokes and writing a dot.
Depending on the direction of the stroke, the meaning of the stroke is a different letter. The strokes
are the simplest possible:
* A straight stroke
* A slightly curved stroke
* A stroke with a loop in the middle

By writing these strokes in different directions, different letters are selected. 8 directions are used,
creating 45 degree sectors. For curve and looped stroke, also the side of the cure or loop affects the
selection of the letter. Bloom contains a display that shows the user to which stroke each letter is
assigned.

Bloom was available in the Google play store for a long time. Soon a new version will be published
based on the code you find here in GitHub.
